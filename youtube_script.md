## 0:00 - 0:45: The Hook & The Problem

**Visuals:**
*   Montage of Iron Man's JARVIS interface (futuristic, sleek).
*   Cut to: An elderly person struggling with a smartphone, looking confused at a banking app, then switching to a food delivery app, looking stressed.
*   Text Overlay: "JARVIS: A Superhero's Sidekick?"
*   Text Overlay changes to: "Jarbest: A Hero for the Helpless."

**Audio (Voiceover):**
"When we think of AI Agents, we often think of Iron Man's JARVIS—a reliable sidekick for a superhero. But what if we reimagined that power? What if the people who need a super-intelligent assistant aren't billionaire superheroes, but the elderly and the visually impaired?"

"For them, the digital world isn't convenient; it's a minefield. Fragmented apps, small text, and confusing interfaces make independence a struggle. They don't need just another app. They need a guardian."

*   Text Overlay: "Unified. Voice-Ready. Secure."

**Audio:**
"Meet Jarbest. My submission for the Kaggle Agents for Good track. Jarbest isn't just a chatbot; it's a unified interface for your entire digital life."

"Instead of juggling ten different apps, you have one conversation. Jarbest connects to your bank via the Model Context Protocol (MCP) and external vendors like pizza shops and e-commerce stores using the Agent-to-Agent (A2A) protocol."

## 1:30 - 2:30: The Demo (Scenario: Safe & Independent Living)

**Visuals:**
*   Split screen: On the left, a chat interface. On the right, a visualization of the 'Guardian Protocol' checking the bank balance.
*   **User (Text/Voice):** "Jarbest, I'm hungry. Can you order my usual pizza? But please, check my balance first. I'm worried about my pension."

**Audio:**
"Let's see it in action. Our user wants to order dinner but is anxious about their finances. Watch how Jarbest acts as a protective layer."

**Visuals:**
*   **Jarbest (Thinking):** "Checking Balance..." -> "Balance: $500 (Safe)" -> "Retrieving Memory: Large Pepperoni" -> "Placing Order..."
*   **Jarbest (Response):** "I've got you covered. I checked your balance, and you have $500, so it's safe to spend $25. I've ordered your usual Large Pepperoni. It will be there in 30 minutes."

**Audio:**
"Did you see that? Jarbest didn't just order the pizza. It first verified the user's financial health using its 'Guardian Protocol'. It remembered their preference using its memory layer. It turned a complex, stressful task into a simple, reassuring interaction."
